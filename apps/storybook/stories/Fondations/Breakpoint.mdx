# ShelterUI Design System breakpoint

The breakpoints defined in ShelterUI ensure a responsive layout that can be adapted to different screen sizes.
They guarantee a consistent and optimal user experience on the most common devices, from smartphones to widescreen (4K) desktops.

## Breakpoints

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>min size</th>
      <th>max size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mobile</td>
      <td>0px</td>
      <td>667px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tablet</td>
      <td>668px</td>
      <td>1023px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small Desktop</td>
      <td>1024px</td>
      <td>1279px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Medium Desktop</td>
      <td>1280px</td>
      <td>1599px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Large Desktop</td>
      <td>1600px</td>
      <td>And more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> To account for the margins of the Edge browser, a tolerance of 8 px can be applied during implementation.

## Breakpoints details

1. **Mobile (0px -667px)**
   - Description: This breakpoint covers most smartphones in portrait mode.
   - Usage: To ensure that content is readable and navigable on small smartphone screens.
2. **Tablet (668px - 1023px)**
   - Description: Designed for portrait tablets and small laptops.
   - Use: Adapt the layout to take advantage of the extra width of tablets while maintaining optimal readability.
3. **Small Desktop (1024px - 1279px)**
   - Description: Optimized for most laptops and large tablet screens in landscape mode.
   - Use: Provide a flexible layout that adapts well to medium-sized screens.
4. **Medium Desktop (1280px - 1599px)**
   - Description: Suitable for standard desktop screens, offering a large, clear interface.
   - Application: Maximize the use of available space on standard desktop screens while maintaining a clean aesthetic.
5. **Large Desktop (1600px and more)**
   - Description: For very wide screens such as 4K or ultra-wide.
   - Application: Take full advantage of the extra screen space to offer an enriched user experience.

## Good Practices

- **Flexibility**: Use flexible breakpoints to ensure that content remains fluid and adapts naturally to different screen sizes.
- **Legibility**: Prioritize content legibility, especially on small screens. Adjust font sizes and spacing accordingly.
- **Navigation**: Check that navigation remains intuitive and accessible on all screen sizes, especially for mobile users.
- **Testing**: Test designs on different devices to ensure consistency and functionality at every breakpoint.

## Using SCSS Mixins

ShelterUI provides three SCSS mixins to easily handle responsive media queries:

### `media-exceeds-width`

Use this mixin to target screens wider than a specific breakpoint.

```scss
@include media-exceeds-width(tablet) {
  .my-element {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

### `media-less-than-width`

Use this mixin to target screens smaller than a specific breakpoint.

```scss
@include media-less-than-width(desktop-small) {
  .my-element {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### `media-between-widths`

Use this mixin to target screens between two breakpoints.

```scss
@include media-between-widths(tablet, desktop-medium) {
  .my-element {
    margin: 2rem;
  }
}
```
