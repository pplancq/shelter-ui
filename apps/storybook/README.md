# @pplancq/shelter-ui-storybook

This private package serves as an interactive documentation for the `shelter-ui` design system components.  
It uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to allow developers and designers to visualize, test, and explore components in isolation.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide a single source of truth for the design system components. It allows:

- Documenting components with interactive examples.
- Visually testing components in different states.
- Facilitating collaboration between developers and designers.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Get started

### Run Storybook

To start Storybook in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open a web interface where you can explore the components.

### Build Storybook

Build Storybook for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project structure

- **`.storybook/`**: Storybook-specific configuration.
- **`stories/`**: Storybook stories for each component.
