# Copilot instructions

## Language Policy

All instructions and prompts in this repository must be written in English. This applies to:

- All rule and instruction files in `.github/instructions/`
- All prompt files in `.github/prompts/`
- All documentation and code comments intended for contributors

## Development code generation

When working with typescript, C# code, follow these instructions very carefully.

It is **EXTREMELY important that you follow the instructions in the rule files very carefully.**

### Workflow implementation

**IMPORTANT:** Always follow these steps when implementing new features:

1. Consult any relevant instructions files listed below and start by listing which rule files have been used to guide the implementation (e.g. `Instructions used: [a11y.instructions.md, vitest.instructions.md]`).

2. Fix any compiler warnings and errors before going to the next step.

## Best practices

- always use english for code, documentation, tests, and more.
