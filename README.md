## Overview

ShelterUI is a modular and scalable design system built to streamline UI development and ensure consistency across projects.  
Designed with modern front-end practices in mind, it provides reusable components, well-structured styles, and flexible theming options.

This repository serves as both a **sandbox for UX/UI experimentation** and a **practical foundation for my future projects**.

## Motivation

The primary goal behind ShelterUI is to **explore, refine, and document UX/UI practices** while overcoming common design system challenges.

As a front-end developer specializing in React, I wanted a structured and maintainable tool that aligns with modern development workflows.  
This project is not only an exercise in technical proficiency but also a learning hub for accessibility, scalability, and component-driven architecture.

Whether applied to real-world projects or simply used as an evolving reference, ShelterUI allows **rapid prototyping** without sacrificing quality.

## Repository Structure

ShelterUI is organized into distinct packages to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance:

- **`package/css`** – Houses the SCSS rules for styling, ensuring a flexible and structured approach to theme management.
- **`package/icon`** – Contains scalable SVG assets for icons, optimized for various use cases.
- **`package/react`** – The core React components of the design system, designed for reusability and consistency.
- **`apps/storybook`** – An interactive documentation space powered by Storybook, allowing developers to explore and test UI components in isolation.

## Development & Future Plans

ShelterUI is actively evolving, with planned improvements including:

- Expanded component library with additional reusable UI elements.
- Enhanced theme customization and accessibility considerations.
- Storybook refinements for better interactivity and documentation.
- Performance optimizations for styling and asset handling.

Although the package is **not yet published to NPM**, it is structured with future scalability in mind.  
Once stabilized, ShelterUI will be made available for broader use.

## Contributions & Feedback
